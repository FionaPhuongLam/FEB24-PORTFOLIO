## PURPOSE:
### The purpose of this portfolio assignment is show my educators how much of an understanding I have of this topic. Not only that, it is to also showcase my set skills for potential future employers and companies in the near future. This website that has been created lists down information about myself, which can give employers and anyone a quick insight of who I am as an individual and web-developer. Although there is a blogs/portfolio section, there is nothingg in there as of yet, but the website will be updated during my time at Coder Academy.

## TARGET AUDIENCE:
### As listed above, the target audience for this website is for future employers and companies. This website, even after it has been properly filled with future content, will showcase the skills that I will have learnt over the year and how I am able to use them to the best of my abilities.

## Functionality & Features
### So far the website is only available for mobile devices and desktop. It was created with the idea for a more Mobile oriented idea at first, so the desktop version may not appear as different to the mobile or seem less seamless. 
### The website doesn't contain as much information as of right now, and is still in the early stages (of my skillset) but the navigation bars should work fine in directing to other pages/sections of the website, as well as the contacts pages and hyperlinks to GITHUB and LINKEDIN.
